# Sentiment Analysis

TODO

[ ] Application code
    [ ] POST /analyze, returns "positive", 200 or "negative", 200
[ ] Tests
    [ ] Unit tests
    [ ] Integration tests
    [ ] Regression tests
[ ] Build
    [ ] Some sort of linting step
    [ ] Some sort of coverage

A good solution would be

[ ] A pipeline consisting of
    [ ] Unit tests
    [ ] Build
    [ ] Deploy to dev
    [ ] Regression test
    [ ] Deploy to prod
    [ ] Regression test
[ ] Another pipeline consisting of
    [ ] Integration tests on a schedule
